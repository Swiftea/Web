        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Swiftea/Crawler">Crawler</a>: it browses the web to know a maximum of webpages and fill our database. It is coded in Python.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Swiftea/Web">Web</a>: this is the interface that shows you the results of your search and provides you an access to our database by using our API. It is written in PHP.</li>

    <h2>Ranking</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>The results you see when you perform a search are classified according to several criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf">TF-IDF</a> method</li>
            <li>A score calculated uniquely for each page</li>
            <li>A popularity index measured by the crawler</li>
            <li>The keywords in the address of each page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a page abuses the use of optimized keywords, it is penalized in the results.</p>
